		"<b>Toussaint Auguste</b>, born in Leogane in 1925, is said to have been active in the Episcopal Diocese as a lay reader and a teacher before becoming a painter in the late 1940s. He was among the early painters working at the Centre d'Art in Port-au-Prince. Considered one of the First Generation Masters, examples of his work can be found in many museums--including the permanent collections of the Musee d'Art Haitien du College Saint Pierre in Port-au-Prince and the Milwaukee Museum of Art--and in most books on Haitian art.",
		"Toussaint Auguste was represented in the Cathedral of Sainte Trinite in Port-au-Prince with the murals <em>Flight into Egypt</em> and <em>The Temptation of Adam and Eve.</em> (The Cathedral was destroyed in the earthquake of 10 January 2010.) In 1966, his <em>Nativity</em> was featured on a UNICEF Christmas card. He moved to the United States in 1967, first settling in Brooklyn, New York, and then in Queens, New York in 1972."
