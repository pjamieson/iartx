		"<b>Wilfrid Louis</b> was born in Port-au-Prince on April 17, 1943, and studied at l'Academie des Beaux-Arts from 1963 to 1970. There he learned casting, drawing and ceramics. Regarded as one of Haiti's finest artists, Louis uses a palette knife to blend only the three primary colors into subtly different shades. He founded his own atelier, <i>La Maloulou</i>, and his prior students include <a href='#!/artists/joseph-reynald'>Reynald Joseph</a>.",
		"John Ripton, adjunct professor of Caribbean history at Rutgers University, says Louis wants to distinguish his art from primitivism and that the artist's inspiration <i>'comes from the people, from the experience of life on the streets, the joy the sadness, the wisdom of a poverty-stricken people which, in spite of everything, retains hope in the future.'</i>"
