	"bio": [
		"<b>M. Desrosiers</b> was born on March 22, 1927 in Port-au-Prince. After graduating from high school, he became a Customhouse Surveyor. In 1955, he became a member of the school Foyer des Arts Plastiques that was formed by a group of sophisticated artists who were dissatisfied with how issues affecting Haitian painters were addressed. Desrosiers won a bronze medal at the National Art Exhibition organized by the tourism office in 1959. He exhibited in the Win-Ding Festival of Chicago in 1963, and at Art Expo in 1967. He is listed in Eva Pataki's book, <em>Haitian Painting: Art and Kitsch</em>, and illustrations of his paintings can be seen in John Allen Franciscus' book, <em>Haiti: Voodoo Kingdom To Modern Riviera</em> and in Clovis Desinor's book, <em>Haiti: The First Negro Republic in the New World</em>. Desrosiers has exhibited in the USA, and at many galleries in Haiti and Europe."
