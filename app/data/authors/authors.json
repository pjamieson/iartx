The setting, Trinidad, and the theme of drugs draw attention to the position of the region as a staging post in the international drugs trade. Police officer Maureen Mason-Adams is unswerving in her commitment to the fight against drugs. When she discovers that fellow officers, including her husband, are in league with Trinidadian and Grenadian drug runners, the clean-up campaign becomes a personal crusade. At risk to her life, Maureen embarks on an island-hopping investigation of a multimillion-dollar trade conducted by some of the Caribbean's most dangerous men. [Heinemann blurb]"

Apata is an imaginative reconstruction of the life of the man at its center, a charismatic young Guianese whose hopes of a brilliant future are frustrated by the color of his skin. Despite his obvious abilities, he cannot complete his education, and is forced instead to take up ignominious work for Glenn, a white homosexual trader. Trapped by a system of prejudices, and deeply humiliated, Apata is pushed into a cycle of crime that leads to the life of a fugitive, and a grisly demise. Harold Bascom's Apata is the story of victims and outcasts everywhere, a gripping adventure that confronts a confusing and hurtful period when different cultures collided. (Heinemann blurb)"

			"Kamau Brathwaite was born in Barbados in 1930. He graduated from England's Cambridge University with a B.A. in history in his early 20s, and received his Ph.D. from the University of Sussex in 1968. He lived and worked in Ghana from 1955 to 1962. From the 'rooflessness' of his sojourn in Europe, Brathwaite found a rootedness in Africa that would sharpen his sense of 'wholeness' and shape his awareness, making him what the Ghanaian poet Kofi Awoonor once called 'a poet of the total African consciousness.' The Arrivants: A New World Trilogy (1973) and the second trilogy, Mother Poem (1977), Sun Poem (1982) and X/Self (1987) are among Brathwaite's published works that surged his international standing.",
			"Brathwaite, the distinguished Caribbean poet, historian and literary critic, lives in Barbados at Cow Pastor, part of an estate that includes the sacred burial ground of his ancestors that were enslaved. He has taught at the University of the West Indies and lectured at New York University. Awards and honors for his poetry and non-fiction include the Guggenheim Fellowship, Fulbright Fellowship, Bussa Award, Casa de las Americas Prize for Literary Criticism, and the Neustadt International Prize for Literature."

A frequent and much respected visitor to the Caribbean, much liked for his deep but modestly offered knowledge of the region and its literature, and his aimiable good humour, Stewart Brown's poetry never forgets that, however immersed it is in local sympathies, it remains the work of an Englishman abroad, an honesty which ensures that the work is never compromised by sentiment."
