					unhappily with her African husband, Zek. Their uneasy existence is further disturbed by

					This portrait of an African community torn between progress and tradition and subject

			Cyril Dabydeen was born in the Canje, Guyana, in 1945. His father was a marginal cattle farmer, his mother a seamstress. He grew up with his grandmother and an extended family of aunt, nieces, nephews. He is a cousin of the writer David Dabydeen. In the early 1970s he left Guyana for Canada to obtain higher education. In his early years in Canada he worked in a variety of casual jobs, most importantly as a tree planter in the Canadian forests of the north, where he worked with Native Canadians. It was this experience which was part of the process of the drawing of imaginative connections between Guyana and Canada, both with large ‘unpeopled’ hinterlands and surviving native peoples.

			David Dabydeen was born on a sugar estate in Berbice, Guyana in 1957. His family lived for a time in New Amsterdam where he attended school. He recalls moving back to his family village, Brighton, during the 1964 race riots. At the age of around ten he won a scholarship to Queen’s College in Georgetown where he studied for a couple of years. He was sent to England at the age of twelve in 1969 and was in care until he was sixteen. He won a scholarship to Cambridge University and read English there and at London Universities, completing his doctorate in 1982. He was a post-doctoral fellow at Oxford University for three years. He is currently Professor at the Centre for Caribbean Studies, University of Warwick and was for some years a roving ambassador for Guyana.

			At 12, Edwidge Danticat spoke almost no English. At 26, she has been nominated for one
			of the most prestigious awards in literature. Her collection of short stories, Krik?
			Krak!, explores the island of her birth, Haiti, blending its poetry and its tremendous
			pain.
			Reached at her Brooklyn home where she lives with her parents, Danticat says she draws
			on the stories she heard as a little girl. &quot;We take great pride in our past,'' says
			Danticat in her gently accented English. Her first languages were Creole and French. When
			she was a toddler, her parents left Haiti to find a better life in the U.S. She stayed
			with an aunt and uncle until she rejoined them at 12.
			While her stories are set in contemporary Haiti, Danticat brings in historical
			characters like the 1790s slave leader Boukman and events like the killings in 1937 at
			Massacre River (when soldiers in the Dominican Republic slaughtered Haitians).
			Although she is a U.S. citizen, Danticat remains connected to Haiti, which she has
			visited recently. Krik? Krak! is being translated into Creole for Haitian radio. Danticat
			also served as the associate producer of a documentary made by Jonathan Demme about
			Haitian torture survivors, Courage and Pain.
			Danticat always wanted to write, but she planned to train as a nurse after she
			graduated from Barnard College with a degree in French literature. Like many children of
			emigrants, Danticat felt great pressure to become &quot;a doctor, a lawyer, an engineer.''
			Only because she had a scholarship did she attend Brown University to earn an MFA in
			creative writing instead of attending nursing school. Her much-praised first novel,
			Breath, Eyes, Memory, was published in 1994. (From USA TODAY - May 1997)

			Gloria Escoffery was born in 1923 in Gayle, St Mary, Jamaica. Her father was a government medical officer and her mother was a professional violinist and Bridge champion. The family (who are white Jamaicans) can trace their arrival in Jamaica in the late 18th century, probably from Haiti after the revolution of 1790. She was educated at St Hilda’s School and was Jamaica Scholar in 1942. She studied at McGill University (Montreal), Slade School of Fine Art (London) and at the University of West Indies School of Education.
			She started out work as a journalist on the Public Opinion newspaper, taught art in Kingston and then taught English for many years at Brown’s Town Community College until her retirement in 1985.
			She is one of Jamaica’s most outstanding painters, her work first coming to notice in the 1940s. Her paintings of rural Jamaican life are particularly well known, with strong sympathies for grass-roots people, though there is nothing sentimental in her work, which has strong surreal, non-figurative elements. She is also an important art critic, with scores of articles in Jamaica Journal over the years. She was awarded the Order of Distinction in 1977 and the Silver Musgrave medal in 1989 for her services in the field of art.
			She died in 2002.

			Brenda Flanagan was born in Trinidad in 1949, the twelfth of fourteen children in an impoverished family. Her father was a barman, her mother a laundress. Brenda Flanagan recalls having a hunger for involvement with the wider world and dreamt of being a writer. She started writing poetry at the age of ten and by thirteen she was singing calypsos and earning money for it. However, at the age of fourteen she had to leave school to help support her family, by then only parented by her mother. She worked for a time in a factory, then was taken on as a trainee reporter of The Nation, the newspaper of the then ruling People's National Movement led by Dr. Eric Williams.			
			In 1967 she left Trinidad for the USA, working initially as a domestic servant. Marriage and motherhood deflected her plans to study, but by 1975, then a single mother, she began undergraduate studies at the University of Michigan. There she won prestigious Hopwood Awards for her short stories, a novel and drama ('When the Jumbie Bird Calls').

		"bio": "Beryl Agatha Gilroy (nee Alnwich) was born on 30 August, 1924 in Skeldon village, in Berbice County in British Guiana. She grew up in a large, extended family, largely under the influence of her maternal grandmother. Her grandmother took the view that the child would learn more by being taken all over the county with her, and being given space for wonder and enquiry, than in the regimented system of primary schooling. As a result Beryl Gilroy did not enter full time schooling until she was twelve. It is clear that much of her grandmother’s influence persisted in Beryl Gilroy’s own philosophy of education (she educated her own children at home) that stressed freedom for discovery within a framework of basic skills. Between 1951-53 she attended the University of London pursuing a Diploma in Child Development. Although a qualified teacher, racism prevented her getting a post for some time, and she had to work as a washer-up at Lyons, a factory clerk and lady’s maid. Between 1970-75 she wrote the pioneering children’s series 'Nippers' which contain probably the first reflection of the Black British presence in UK writing for children. In addition to her fiction and autobiographical books, she was a pioneering teacher and psychotherapist who was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by the University of London and an Honorary Fellowship by the Institute of Education for her writing and pioneering work as a psychotherapist. She died in 2001 at the age of 76.",

He alone escapes as his shipmates are slaughtered, and is rescued by Yarico, a Carib woman who takes him as, 'an ideal, strange and obliging lover.' So begins an erotic encounter, explored with poetic, imaginative intensity, which has a profound effect on both. Inkle and Yarico is loosely based on a 'true' story which became a much repeated popular narrative in the 17th and 18th centuries. Beryl Gilroy reinterprets its mythic dimensions from both a woman's and a black perspective, but above all she engages the reader in the psychological truths of her characters' experiences.

				A novel. When a group of Jamaican students and their lecturers begin an archaeological dig on the old estate of Plantation Plains, each has different expectations. 'Jean Goulbourne’s Excavation gives a refreshing perspective on a subject that has long troubled the West Indies - the nature of identity in a multiracial society haunted by a history of colonialism...Goulbourne’s writing style is stimulating - especially in the portrayal of the island’s landscape - and as she draws the reader into the lives of her characters, we gain a fresh perspective on West Indian culture, history, and politics.' - Geoffrey Philp, The Caribbean Writer.

				In Woman Song, Jean Goulbourne articulates the grief, hopes and unquenchable spirit of black women in the Caribbean. She writes with the directness of the reggae lyric, with both pungency and humour, and with an aphoristic economy which has the art of saying more with less. Her poems encompass the lives of women old and young; middle-class and sufferers; women whose lives are enclosed, who want liberation from the 'station of motherhood, wifehood and frustration', and women who through their resistance, creativity and assertion of selfhood have made space for themselves. The celebration of such lives stands as a beacon of hope in the depiction of Jamaican society in which rape, poverty and abandonment are too frequently women's lot.

			Cecil Gray was born in Port of Spain, Trinidad in modest circumstances in 1923. Reading and schooling provided him with a route towards security, a gift he has repaid by his lifelong commitment to education. He obtained a teacher’s certificate and an external degree from London University. For many years he taught at UWI St Augustine, training secondary teachers in teaching English. In 1976 he was awarded the Medal of Merit, Class One, Gold, by the Trinidadian Government for his meritorious service in education and culture. His proudest achievement was to have made a key contribution to getting West Indian literature accepted in schools. His lecturing activities in this period undoubtedly held back his own writing, though he had poems published in Bim, Kyk-over-Al, Trinidad and Tobago Review, Savacou, The Greenfield Review and Caribbean Quarterly. However, it was only after he migrated to Canada in 1988, with the hope that distance would enable him to write, that the poems flowed.

			Charles Borromeo Hodge was born on November 9, 1939, to St.Martin parents in San Nicholas, Aruba. He was raised
			by his grandmother, Ann Catherine Hodge, in St.Martin, where he attended St. Joseph School. He completed elementary
			and high school (HBS) in Curacao, where he won the Neerlandia Prijs for composition writing. In 1959, Hodge, with
			high school diploma in hand, headed home, again. That same year, the grass roots political activist Leonides "Bahba"
			Richardson, introduced Hodge to the nation's father of journalism and political progressive Joseph H. Lake, Sr.
			Lake's influence on Hodge's writing and political development would be profound and not without controversy.
			Hodge's first poem, "The Rock," appeared in a 1959 issue of Lake's Winward Islands Opinion. He also wrote articles
			"of a radical nature," at a time when many St.Martiners hid in the alleys of Great Bay (Philipsburg) to buy the
			Opinion newspaper, because of its writings against "slave wages" and the political system that were "keeping down
			people." In 1970, Hodge emigrated to Harlem, USA. In that "Black Mecca" of New York City, the St.Martiner wrote most
			of the poems of his first volume, Songs & Images for St.Martin (1997). In 1991, Hodge returned to St.Martin, "to
			stay." After his return home, his poems, short stories, essays, and commentaries appeared with ravenous persistency
			in especially the daily St.Maarten Guardian. The senior poet's writings also appeared regularly in the nation's other
			publications until his death in 1998.

			Towering, breathtakingly limber interpretive dancer Geoffrey Holder was 
			born in Trinidad and educated at Queens Royal College. Holder's first 
			professional dancing gig was in his brother Roscoe's travelling troupe. He 
			toured the West Indies and Puerto Rico before making his New York stage debut in 
			the 1954 Broadway musical House of Flowers. Heading his own troupe 
			from 1956 onward, Holder appeared as both an ensemble dancer and as soloist and 
			choreographer in 'outside' productions. He made his dramatic bow in 1957 in the 
			near-mime role of Lucky in 'Waiting for Godot.' His subsequent stage 
			work has earned him numerous awards, including two Tonys--one for direction, the 
			other for costume design--for 1974's 'The Wiz.' His film roles 
			leaned towards the exotic, e.g. Baron Samedi in the 1973 James Bond thriller 
			'Live and Let Die' (1973) and Punjab in 'Annie' (1981). 
			He is best known to TV fans for his series of mid-1970 Seven Up commercials, in 
			which he elegantly and laughingly extoled the virtues of "Un-Cola Nuts." Outside 
			of his theatrical and film accomplishments, Holder is an accomplished painter, 
			his works having been showcased in several major international exhibitions. He 
			is also the author of several books. Geoffrey Holder is married to dancer Carmen de Lavallade.

			Drisana Deborah Jack is at the articulate edge of a small and exciting batch of St.Martiners who are,
			sometimes simultaneously, busy in literature, art, dance, song, and music, lighting and unprecedented
			crop of creative fires. Their energy become the essential fuel for the nation's cultural launch, or leap,
			into the twenty-first century. These cultural workers come at a time when they are urgently needed at
			home. Their vanguard is earning critical attention throughout the Caribbean and beyond from noted artists
			and institutions. When Drisana--also busy in art and theater--was granted a Fellow by the Caribbean Writers
			Institute, University of Miami (1996), she was already being called a leader and "a most promising poet"
			among St. Martin's cultural brat pack in the Newsday and Guardian newspapers. Her recitals have been at
			functions ranging from a "book party" for scholar George Lamming to a protest against the proposed
			"Franco-Dutch" colonial treaty. Before graduating from Marist College (BA, 1993), she had been published
			in MC's Collection of Non-fiction Student Writings, listed in Who's Who of Students in American Colleges
			and Universities, and picked up the National Collegiate Communications Award. The Rainy Season (1997) is
			Drisana's first published volume of poems.

			Peter Lauchmonen Kempadoo was born on a sugar estate in Guyana in 1926, in a community mainly of Indians whose foreparents had come from Madras. After leaving school he worked for a time in the sugar factory, then as a teacher and later as a reporter in Georgetown. He has returned frequently to Guyana where he did important work in the 1970s taping folk performances and documenting a people's culture which has now largely disappeared. He lived for some years in Barbados, and has worked in the Caribbean, Africa and Asia, carrying out rural development work among grass-roots communities, but has mainly been based in the UK where he first moved in 1953.

			Ismith Khan was born in Trinidad in 1925. He grew up within a Muslim family, who came from the country to Port of Spain, strongly influenced by his grandfather, a Pathan from Northern India, who was a militant community leader who had been shot and wounded by the colonial authorities in their suppression of the San Fernando Hosay rebellion of 1884. Ismith Khan attended Queen’s Royal College in Port of Spain and later worked as a reporter on the Trinidad Guardian. He was a close Trinidad friend of Sam Selvon, who edited the literary page of this paper before he emigrated to the UK. Khan himself left Trinidad in the 1950s to study at Michigan State University and Johns Hopkins University. Ismith Khan lived in New York until his death in April 2002.

					work on the estates, the laborers were forced to move on, to survive in a hostile world
					not knowing where the next day's bread would come from. This is the story of their lives,
					their resilience and their ultimate survival. (Publisher's blurb)

			Born in the village of Harris, Montserrat, West Indies in 1939, E .A. (Archie) Markham's large, cultivated, extended family (theirs was, as his friend Howard Fergus describes, a 'near Great-House') continues to provide him with much material for his fiction and poetry. He began a classical education at Montserrat's only grammar school, but left the island in his youth to complete his education in Britain. Nevertheless, he has remained closely concerned with the fortunes of Monserrat, particularly after the devastating hurricane Hugo of 1989 and the volcanic eruption of a few years later that continues to threaten Montserrat's very existence as a society.

					From memories of turn-of-the-century Dominica to the contemporary USA, Africa, and
					Britain, 31 women writers from throughout the Caribbean express the loss and the longing,
					the pride and passion of the Caribbean identity. Differences of language -- English,
					French, Spanish -- point to a common history of migration and imperialism. The precision
					of &quot;standard English&quot; and the poetry of creole embody the rich contradictions of
					that heritage. Rooted in African old-tradition, a modern self-defining consciousness
					insists on calling itself by its 'true-true name.'
					The selections, arranged by country, include the following writers: Guyana -- Beryl
					Gilroy, Grace Nichols, Janice Shinebourne. Belize -- Zee Edgell. Cuba -- Omega Aguero,
					Mirta Yanez. Jamaica -- Erna Brodber, Michelle Cliff, Christine Craig, Velma Pollard, Joan
					Riley, Olive Senior, Sylvia Wynter Carew. Haiti -- Marie Chauvet (Marie Vieux). Dominican
					Republic -- Hilma Contreras. Puerto Rico -- Rosario Ferre, Magali Garcia Ramis, Carmen
					Lugo Filippi, Ana Lydia Vega. Antigua -- Jamaica Kincaid. Guadeloupe -- Maryse Conde,
					Simone Schwarz-Bart, Myriam Warner-Vieyra. Dominica --Jean Rhys, Phyllis Shand Allfrey,
					Barbados -- Paule Marshall. Grenada -- Merle Collins. Trinidad and Tobago --
					Dionne Brand, Rosa Guy, Marion Patrick-Jones, Merle Hodge.

			Nehesi Publishers, for which Sekou serves as projects director, he encourages and promotes young writers and has
			secured the publication of books by an unprecedented number of St.Martiners. Since 1986, House of Nehesi has
			published more books in and about St.Martin, and by St.Martin writers,
			than any similar period in the island's post-Colombian history. Sekou has helped to demystify the writing and
			publishing of books by St.Martiners in St.Martin. He continues personally and through House of Nehesi to encourage
			critical research, reading, and writing, particularly with regard to St.Martin/Caribbean oral and recorded history,
			culture, and the natural environment. Sekou has secured the publication of literary/scholarly books by writers from
			Saba, Curacao, Barbados, Tortola, and the USA.
			Sekou has recited at the prestigious University of The West Indies Caribbean Writers Series, and for other universities,
			international festivals, and organizations throughout the Caribbean, USA, England, Germany, The Netherlands, and Korea.
			Scholars/writers Kamau Brathwaite (UWI/New York University), Dr. Howard Fergus (Montserrat), Dr. Joseph Pereira
			(UWI/Jamaica), Wim Rutgers (Aruba), Daniella Jeffry (St.Martin), Fabian Badejo (St.Martin) are among those who consider
			Sekou to be one of the most prolific new generation Caribbean poets. According to Dr. Fergus, Sekou's writings and his
			work at House of Nehesi are serving not only to bring St.Martin's culture to the region and the world but also to let
			the world know that there are serious literary activities going on in the eastern Caribbean.
			Sekou's poetry and reviews of his writings have appeared in Callaloo, Discover St. Martin-St.Maarten, The Caribbean
			Writer, Del Caribe (Cuba), The Massachusetts Review (USA), De Gids (The Netherlands), Revue Noir (France), and other
			national, regional and international journals and magazines. Sekou's articles on history, culture, and politics appear

				scholarships in a racist, class-ridden culture. He wrestles with both the guilt of knowing
				so little about his African heritage and the simultaneous pressure to think, speak, and
				act as a white person. And he will bring disgrace on his family if he does not suppress
				his emerging homosexuality. (Publisher's blurb)

				When Helene is packing up her belongings in readiness for her imminent move and

				effect it will have upon her own future. It is the diary of Juletane, a young West Indian
				woman. Written over three weeks, it records her short life; her lonely childhood in
				France, her marriage to an African student, and her eager return, with him, to Africa --
				the land of her ancestors. In stark contrast to her naive illusions, the social realities
				of traditional Muslim life and their cultural demands on her as a woman threaten to drive
				her to unendurable extremes of loneliness and complete alienation. She is a foreigner, in
				spite of the color of her skin. (Heinemann blurb)

				Britain, 31 women writers from throughout the Caribbean express the loss and the longing,
				the pride and passion of the Caribbean identity. Differences of language -- English,
				French, Spanish -- point to a common history of migration and imperialism. The precision
				of &quot;standard English&quot; and the poetry of creole embody the rich contradictions of
				that heritage. Rooted in African old-tradition, a modern self-defining consciousness
				insists on calling itself by its 'true-true name.'
				The selections, arranged by country, include the following writers: Guyana -- Beryl
				Gilroy, Grace Nichols, Janice Shinebourne. Belize -- Zee Edgell. Cuba -- Omega Aguero,
				Mirta Yanez. Jamaica -- Erna Brodber, Michelle Cliff, Christine Craig, Velma Pollard, Joan
				Riley, Olive Senior, Sylvia Wynter Carew. Haiti -- Marie Chauvet (Marie Vieux). Dominican
				Republic -- Hilma Contreras. Puerto Rico -- Rosario Ferre, Magali Garcia Ramis, Carmen

			returning home in 1969, and serving in Barbados' Ministry of Foreign Affairs and at the Caribbean Tourism
			Research Centre. She was instrumental in establishing the National Independence Festival of creative Arts
			(NIFCA) in 1973, and for nearly thirty years has been representing her country and the cultural arts on
			national, regional and international boards, committees and fora in dance, theater and tourism. The
			president of Stage One Theatre Productions (1980-1982), manager of the Barbados Dance Theatre Company
			(1985-1988) and administrative director of WWB Productions (1986-1996), Wilson has also served as chairperson
			of the Association of Caribbean Theatre Artists (ACTA) and a director of the CARICOM Foundation for Arts and
			Culture. She is a member of numerous other cultural foundations, including the Barbados museum and historical
			society. Fluent in French and Spanish, she is well-known in Barbados and other parts of the Caribbean as an
			actor, storyteller, producer and dancer. As one of Barbados' grandes dames of the cultural arts, Wilson has
			produced 'Paint it Jazz' for the Barbados Jazz Festival (1994-1995), as well as the official presentations
			for royal visits and visiting dignitaries and heads of state (1975-1990), and numerous dance, musical and
			theater productions. In 1998, this wife and mother of three founded her nation's Stroke Support Group. The
			writing of poetry and stories has been a consistent but mostly private part of Wilson's life and professional
			career and 'Same Sea . Another Wave' is her first book and the fruit of a long-standing dream. Awards and
