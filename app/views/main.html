	<h3 align="center">A list compiled by Patrick Jamieson</h3>

	<p>This is a reference listing of "literature" by West Indian authors. The emphasis is on prose fiction written in English, however some poetry and nonfiction has been included, as have some works that have been translated to English.</p>

	<p>My definition of a "West Indian Author" is rather broad: Most West Indian authors were born and raised in the West Indies. Some were born elsewhere and parented by at least one West Indian. Others immigrated to the West Indies from another part of the globe. Many West Indian authors have found it necessary to live in other countries in order to better pursue their careers as writers, often becoming citizens of their new home countries. Today, a West Indian Author could live anywhere in the world, and may be "claimed" by both a West Indian country and their country of residence. To me, the defining factor is that the West Indian Author usually writes of West Indian characters and/or concerns with understanding and insight.</p>

	<p>This list is an on-going work-in-progress that has been compiled from individual contributions and a variety of other <a href="#/sources">sources</a>.</p>
