	<h1 align="center">West Indian Literature</h1>

	<h3 align="center">A list compiled by Patrick Jamieson</h3>

	<p>This is a reference listing of "literature" by West Indian authors. The emphasis is on prose fiction written in English, however some poetry and nonfiction has been included, as have some works that have been translated to English.</p>

	<p>My definition of a "West Indian Author" is rather broad: Most West Indian authors were born and raised in the West Indies. Some were born elsewhere and parented by at least one West Indian. Others immigrated to the West Indies from another part of the globe. Many West Indian authors have found it necessary to live in other countries in order to better pursue their careers as writers, often becoming citizens of their new home countries. Today, a West Indian Author could live anywhere in the world, and may be "claimed" by both a West Indian country and their country of residence. To me, the defining factor is that the West Indian Author usually writes of West Indian characters and/or concerns with understanding and insight.</p>

	<p>This list is an on-going work-in-progress that has been compiled from individual contributions and a variety of other <a href="#!/sources">sources</a>.</p>

	<h3 align="center">Featuring an Online Gallery of Haitian Art</h3>

	<div>

		<p><b>The Internet Art Exchange</b> is proud to offer this curated selection of <b>Haitian Art</b>.  Every painting offered for sale here currently hangs in our Northern California home.  Each was deliberately chosen, with a primary consideration being our desire to live with the piece, to revisit and reconsider it almost every day.</p>

		<p>However, obviously, there are so many more wonderful Haitian paintings out there.  That's where selling from our collection comes in: While each sale forces us to part with a painting we love, it also offers us the opportunity to adopt another.</p>

		<b><em><ul>
			<li>We're happy to answer questions and provide additional images.</li>
			<li>We pack well and ship promptly upon clearance of payment.</li>
			<li>Satisfaction guaranteed with returns accepted for any reason.</li>
		</ul></em></b>

		<p>Browse the gallery by selecting from the Artist Index on the left.  You will find multiple images of each painting offered for sale.  Our minimum image resolution of 500x500 pixels may result in delayed loading on older computers or over slow connections, but we believe good images are a <em>must-have</em> on an art site. The second image of any work is always of an even higher resolution, allowing you to zoom in on every detail.</p>

		<p>Enjoy!</p>
